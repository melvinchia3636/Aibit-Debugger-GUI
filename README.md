# AIBIT Debugger GUI

AIBIT debugger GUI, an unofficial debugger for **YLW's AIBIT**. Made with love by **melvinchia3636** and **Slimer210**.


## Why we made this?

 AIBIT is a micro controller board, with cameras and screen on it. Due to it's IDE (aka. IDEA) don't have a proper debugger for user, it's hard to debugging. Besides that, it don't have a simulator for user. It had made a huge problems for users that don't have own microcontroller board.

Furthermore, it's very expensive (about USD100), not everyone can afford it. So, we make this virtual debugger for those who like to use this board, and test his code before compiling to a real board.

We try to make the structure same as the standard AIBIT board, but due to some limitations, some functions may not work. We will also try avoiding those code that not compatible with the native IDE.

## Features

Currently, we still haven't finished this project so not every function can be already used yet. These are all features that may contain here:

 - Standard AIBIT functions
 - GUI for viewing screen
 - Virtual sensor (gyroscope, microphone, touch button, reset button, etc.)

## Usage

    from aibit import * #import all aibit standard modules

## Documentation
Haven't started it yet, but you may take a look at original AIBIT docs (in chinese).
